# ThemeColor

A reference to one of the workbench colors as defined in https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference. Using a theme color is preferred over a custom color as it gives theme authors and users the possibility to change the color.

## Constructors

```typescript
new ThemeColor(id: string): ThemeColor
```
